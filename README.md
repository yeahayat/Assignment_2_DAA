# DAA Assignment 2 - Kadane's Algorithm

## Algorithm
Kadane's Algorithm for maximum subarray sum with position tracking.

## Features
- Finds maximum subarray sum with start/end indices  
- Tracks performance metrics (comparisons, array accesses)  
- 7 comprehensive unit tests  
- CLI benchmark runner with CSV export  

## Complexity
- **Time**: O(n) â€” best, worst, average cases  
- **Space**: O(1) auxiliary space  

## Commands
```bash
mvn compile
mvn test
mvn exec:java
